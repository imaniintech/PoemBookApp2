<h3>My Approach:</h3>
<p>
I love reading poems, writing poems and creating lyrics. I've use a lot of notebooks and although it's nice to write things on paper, it can become very wasteful. On top of it being wasteful, all the paper I use takes up space. For my conclusion, I knew I wanted a place where I could write out my thoughts and got back to them to edit, or read when ever I want.
